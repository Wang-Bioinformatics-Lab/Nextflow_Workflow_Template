    For the take block, you can specify the input parameters that will be passed to the workflow.
    Another option instead of passing all the values, is to use a map, which is a dictionary of key-value pairs.

    --main--
    The main block is where the workflow is defined. You can call other processes and workflows from here.

    --emit--
    This is an optional block and if you are new to nextflow you can ignore it.
    This is can be useful in future generations of nextflow, replacing the need for the 'publishDir' directive.
